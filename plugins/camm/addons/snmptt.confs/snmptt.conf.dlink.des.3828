         acceptable means of restricting the read access that
         could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the

         those views that have read access to all objects on

         During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is

The SNMP trap that is generated when an alarm
entry crosses its falling threshold and generates
an event that is configured for sending SNMP
traps.
Variables:
  1: alarmIndex
     Syntax="INTEGER32"
     Descr="An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the

         Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely
         in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access
         control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of
         this object to identify only those objects that exist
         in a particular MIB view.  Because there is thus no
         acceptable means of restricting the read access that
         could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the
         probe must only grant write access to this object in

         those views that have read access to all objects on
         the probe.

         During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is
         not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error
         must be returned.  If at any time the variable name of
